            <p>I am a 22-year-old soon-to-be web developer. I am a student in the U of M coding boot camp, so far I have learned CSS and HTML and a little JavaScript. A little about my background before I got into coding. I worked mostly with disabled children, first in a clinic helping kids with autism learn skills. From there I left to go work in a school setting. I worked as a special education paraprofessional in a high-needs classroom helping middle school student learn at their level and speed. I soon found that the school environment was not for me and began tutoring high schoolers and middle schoolers in math. I love this and it reminded me of my love for logical problem solving. On my own, I started learning C# and fell in love with coding. I recognized that I probably couldn't teach myself everything I'd want to know before getting a job so I signed up for the boot camp. So far I am loving it! I am so excited to continue my journey to being a web developer!</p>
